In this workshop task i did not have any problems working on the project, instead i learned how to validate attributes, allocate and copy, extract data from an input. I would say my problem has improved over the week. I spent average of 5 hours a day over the course of the study break learning more OOP using C++. Now this project, the `HealthCard` class, which encapsulates basic health card information for individuals in Ontario. The class holds attributes for the person's name, health card number, version code, and stock control number. These attributes are subject to validation rules outlined in the specifications.

The implementation includes private methods to validate the health card attributes, allocate and copy the name, extract characters from input, and print the ID information. Additionally, the class adheres to the "rule of three" by providing a copy constructor, copy assignment operator, and destructor.

A key aspect of the class is its ability to reveal its validity through a Boolean type conversion operator. It can be checked if it represents a valid health card.

The class offers flexibility for creating a health card object with default or custom values. The constructors have been designed to handle these cases efficiently.

The extraction and insertion operators have been overloaded to facilitate reading and displaying health card information from and to input/output streams.

The `HealthCard` class efficiently encapsulates and validates health card information while adhering to good programming practices.
